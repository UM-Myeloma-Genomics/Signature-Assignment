# Signature-Assignment

This code generates a pairwise fitting contribution of user-supplied reference mutational signatures to de novo extracted signatures. Cosine similarities represent the proportional contribution for each solution  to the de novo extracted signature. This approach is particularly useful for the addition and evaluation of non-COSMIC signatures.  This approach is first used in Maura et al. Nat Comm. 2019.  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11037-8
